### Project: Agency-Website-A-C
## About this repo

### Why
 This is a repo for FAC cohort 27 project 1. It is a website for an agency. 
 It documents our approach to making an agency website called Cosmic Designs.
 This project is to help us get used to working with git, github, and workflow as well as working asynchronously. 
 
### What
 - allows other developers to review our code and site
 - allows us to review each others work & organise our workflow

### How
- alternating sections between Cam & Abdi so work is split evenly 
- using branch per issue per section 
- will most likely merge asset/images folder
- creating beta version knowing that we'd return to sort and organise CSS later on
- beta version still testing accessibility as we go
- Still testing different content (and accessibilty) to see how it fits on the page
