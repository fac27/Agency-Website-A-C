### Project: Agency-Website-A-C
## About this website
 This is a website for Cosmic Designs a web development, design, and SEO agency. 
 The website has 5 main sections plus a navigation bar and a footer. The organisation of the page is to guide the user from what we do, what we offer, who we are and how to contact us. 
 
 ### Our Approach in building the webiste
 - creating beta version knowing that we'd return to sort and organise CSS later on
 - beta version still testing accessibility as we go
 - Still testing different content (and accessibilty) to see how it fits on the page

### organisation of work 
- alternating sections between Cam & Abdi so work is split evenly 
- using branch per issue per section 
- will most likely merge asset/images folder
